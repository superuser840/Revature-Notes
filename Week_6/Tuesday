        Wrapped by 
        Application context

            utilize bean scopes and lifecycle

        Beans are essentially your annotated and routed classes
            XML     
                <beans
                <bean
            java
                @component/@repository
                @service/@controller

        @controller handles your endpoints
            handles things where you call @path

        @repository(Daos) connects to @service(middle man) to send to @controller(endpoints/controller)
