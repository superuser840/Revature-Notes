Spring Framework
    Deploy Injection Container
    Alternative to J2EE Enterprise Java Bean
        -a Bean is essentially a fully functioning generate class
        Jax-RS utilize bean
        people didnt want to keep creating bean with getters and setters, hashcode, to string etc.
    Wanted something to handle POJO
    Became modern bean as we know it

    Automatic Dependency Injection
        When an object depends on another object
            ie. a constructor being used in another class
            eg. Calling a connectionUtil in a Dao
        Constructor and Setter injection      

    Dependency injection in Spring
        Connection conn
            public Dao(Connection conn){
            this.conn = conn;
            }
    
    Factory logic
        create a bean factory with good logic to properly handle their beans
            Connection connConnection();
            DaO dao = new DaO(conn);
            Service service = new connection 

    In Spring
        Service service = BeanFactory.get(service);


    Spring Annotations  --  Look up more in spring docs
        some common ones
        @Component
        @Service
        @Qualifier
        @Value
        @Resource
        @AutoRouter
        @

        By Type
        By Name

        Common lifecycle annotation
        pre-construct 
        post-destroy 

        Know lifecycle
        Know scope of bean
