Dev Ops..
    The flow of command for an applicatoin to go from development to deployment

    Development...create app 
    --> Test... integrate, UAT, e2e 
    --> Ops... deploy to servers

    Webapps make bug fixes easier, more important
        - version is always up to date
        - user 'downloads' most updated version every time a site is accessed

        -ordinary users began using services, non-developers generally don't put up with bugs
    ==Caused DevOps to muddy the walls, everybody does everything
            -Much of the process is automated
    Bugs can be fixed in 2 hours
        -A bug is known, sent to Devs 
        -Testing is automated and only stops on Red Light
        -Ops have scripting services to deploy code easily

    Essentially eliminated Desktop Apps in favor of Webapps, 


    Agile/XP/Kanban/Scrum - improve process of product development
    SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle
        -Big Bang  -- start coding and finish when you're finished
        -Waterfall  -- iterative process
        -Scrum  -- 


        Gitflow -- Continuous Integration  - CI  -automated build
            Master-Version users are seeing
                Dev - most built non-deployed version
                    Feature - login
                    Feature - hotfix
                <---
            <---
            Update Master

        Ops Automation split into CI and CD 

        Continuous Integration

        Continuous Delivery
            -Delivery to Integration Testing  -1
            -or Delivery to UAT environment  -2 
            or straight to deployment.      -3

            Essentially a pipeline for how things are getting delivered


Linux
    -most distros are opensource, lightweight, and share simple usage
    Popular distros
        -Ubuntu (mostly in UK)  company based in UK
            -Debian is Ubuntu's root
        -OpenSuSe (Europe)  Company based in germany
        -RedHat (US)    Company based in US
            -fedora
            -RHEL - Redhat Enterprise Linux
            -CentOS
            -AmazonLinux -somewhat based on CentOS

    Common Things for most linux distros

        Package managers
            -apt for Ubunto
            -yum for RedHat
                rpm --ofline package manager for

        shell { reads commands, parses options and interprates meaning
            Different from terminal by (
                emulates a terminal, doesn't directly access a mainframe
        )  Loads env Variables upon startup, eg. PATH
        }
            *bash*
            zsh


    chmod {number} {filename}
        --number convention
        -100  -read
        -200  -execute
        -400  -write
        -each number place is for each user
            first is user
            second is user group
            third is everybody on computer
            eg. chmod 777 file -- gives every user file 

    man 
        manual page 
        opens in less
        can scroll, page up page down.
