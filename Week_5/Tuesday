DevOps Pipeline
    Each arrow is a stage

                            -->QA
    src-->scm-->build Serve-->UAT   --> Quality, Gate, Prod
                            -->Staging


    Continuous Integration + Continuous Delivery
            Tools

            can act as a qualityGate --> codesmells(potential bugs)
                quality gate acts as a check of code to 

            KPI - key performance index
            Code coverage - how much code you test for handling the quality

    Alows companies to dynamically scale services
    History
        On Premesis
            Heirarchy(top layer based on layer beneath it)
            Application
            Data 
            App services (tomcats)
            Libraries/MiddWare
            OS
            Virtualization - Virtual machines running on hardware
            Hardware
                -servers
                -server machines
                -hard drives
            Networking

Cloud is just a copy of on premesis architecture
    Different Levels
        IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
            -Handles networking to Virtualization
            -lets user handle all software
        PaaS - Platform as a service
            -Application and Data handled by User, everything else handled by Cloud
            -Mostly for writing and Deploying applications
            -Heroku
        SaaS - Software as a service
            -Handles everything on the Heirarchy
            -Essentially just a service
            -Gmail

    AWS Became the biggest name in the Cloud vendor market
        Began with Iaas - EC2, elastic cloud compute service

            autoscaling groups- pay for what you use
                -load balancing system  
                -sends traffic based on where its least exposed
            security groups

        after Netflix became popular with IaaS
            -Amazon started Paas-RDS, Elastic Beanstalk
                -most are PaaS now 
        
        SaaS --> Gmail, Netflix, others began 

    Setting up AWS
        -IAM role
            account managment role
        -Create VPC - virtual private cloud
            -immitate a single network
        Security groups
            -What IPs, ports, and protocols are allowed to to access

For qc

RDS and S3 Bucket-- know
setup and navigate EC2



learn ssh command with pem key for AWS
or use Beanstalk
