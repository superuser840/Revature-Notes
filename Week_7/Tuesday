                                        Soap!

What is a Webservice
    Any exposed API
        can use tcp ( Http, smtp, ftp)


        API's should have some sort of specification/Rules
            accept/reject/error Rules
            Some doccumentation


    RESTful API constraints
        swagger(OpenAPI)
        can send JSON/XML inside http request/response

    Before rest there was SOAP 
        WSDL file - integral, cannot work without
            Carriers for envelope (protocol) - XML Document 
                Http
                smtp
                ftp

        Requests not really used, instead a client is essentially downloaded.
        

Whats in the WSDL file? Web Service Definition Language

    XML document Essentialy the rules as to how to use the file
    <Definition
        <type
        <message - what envelope looks like (method signature) format of envelope, header and body of envelope sent to port type and operation
        <porttype - methods youre recieving, (individual operations)
        <operation - for methods
        <binding - for methods
        <service - endpoints
        <ports - endpoints
        <soap:address - endpoint location

>>>Defines how to write envelope<<<

envelope is another xml document (carried in the body of http) only posts, no gets

<envelope
    <head - metadata, 
    <body
        <fault> - error handling, status code


        Decripting the WSDL
            just use a browser extention WSDLer


access wsdl file with endpoint_path?wsdl



Creating a SOAP Service

useful annotations
@WebService: Define to be web service
@WebMethod: Define method to be implemented in service
@WebParam: Define paramater to be used in WebMethod.

    import javax.jws.Webservice

    @WebService
    class Definition

        @WebMethod
        method

        public static void main(
            Endpoint.publish("http://localhost:8080/hello, new BasicSoapDriver())
        )






Soap Cont.
    Simple Object Access Protocol
    consider the wsdl a contract. if its not followed, the operation will not be accessed.

    Apache Crossfire, larger framework that implements Jax-ws. used for soap services
    Apache CF + Spring works together
